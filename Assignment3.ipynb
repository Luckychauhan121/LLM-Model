        "[In class](https://github.com/elhamod/IS883/blob/main/Prompt_Engineering_Agents.ipynb), we have seen the most basic form of chains, a `SequentialChain`. However, other more sophisticated chains exist. Here, you will explore a [`RouterChain`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/router#legacy-routerchain). This chain acts like a switch. Given a condition, it decided which prompt to use. This is in contrast to the deterministic sequantial nature of `SequentialChain`.\n",

It will advise to invest their money and provide them with an investment portfolio based on their savings and using 5 stocks.\n",
        " - Otherwise, FiniBot will politely and cautiously, without taking them on a guilt trip, warn the client about their financial situation. It will then turn into a debt advisor, and create a plan for them to pay off their debt by allocating 10% of their income for monthly debt payments.\n",

At this rate, without accruing additional interest, the debt could be fully repaid in approximately 30 months. It's important to make these payments consistently and avoid incurring additional debt if possible. Additionally, consider finding ways to increase income or decrease expenses to free up more money for debt repayment.

While your savings exceed your debt, it's important to note that maintaining a credit card debt can lead to substantial interest costs over time. Your debt ratio, which is your total debt divided by your total income, is approximately 0.5, meaning that 50% of your income is tied up in debt. It's crucial to focus on reducing this ratio to enhance your financial stability and create a buffer for unexpected expenses.\n",

If you follow this plan, you will be free from your credit card debt in approximately 5 months, provided you do not accrue any additional charges on your credit card. \n",
